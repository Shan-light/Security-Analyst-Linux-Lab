# File-Permissions-In-Linux
The research team at my organization needed to update file permissions for specific files and directories within the projects directory. The existing permissions did not accurately reflect the required authorization levels, posing a potential security risk. To enhance system security and ensure proper access control, I reviewed, verified, and updated file and directory permissions using Linux commands.

## Objectives
This project focuses on enhancing system security by managing and updating file permissions in a Linux environment. It demonstrates how to use basic Bash commands to review, modify, and organize files and directories while ensuring proper access control. The tasks simulate a real-world scenario for a security analyst responsible for maintaining secure directory structures and accurate documentation.

## Skills Learned
- Navigated and managed files and directories using Bash commands

- Verified and updated Linux file permissions to ensure proper access control

- Applied principles of least privilege and secure file management

- Used chmod, chown, and ls -l to analyze and modify permission settings

- Practiced documentation and command-line efficiency for system administration

- Strengthened understanding of Linux security fundamentals relevant to cybersecurity roles

## Tools Used
- Linux (Bash Shell): For executing file and directory management commands

- Nano Text Editor: For creating and editing text files in the command line

- Core Linux Utilities: Commands such as mkdir, rmdir, mv, rm, ls, and cat

- Command-Line Interface (CLI): To simulate real-world system administration tasks

## Tasks
### 1. Create a new directory
- Create a new subdirectory called logs in the /home/analyst directory.
