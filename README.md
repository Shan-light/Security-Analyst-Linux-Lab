# Security-Analyst-Linux-Lab
Practice managing files and directories in Linux using Bash commands.

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to strengthen foundational Linux command-line skills by practicing real-world file and directory management tasks. By completing this lab, skills will be developed in creating, removing, moving, editing files and directories. These are essential tasks performed by system administrators and security analysts.

## Skills Learned
- Navigating the Linux file system using Bash
  
- Creating and removing directories with mkdir and rmdir
  
- Moving, renaming, and deleting files with mv and rm
  
- Editing text files with the nano editor
  
- Verifying directory structures and file contents with ls and cat
  
- Applying file management practices used by system administrators and security analysts
  
- Documenting tasks and changes in a structured way

## Tools Used
- Linux (Bash Shell): For executing file and directory management commands

- Nano Text Editor: For creating and editing text files in the command line

- Core Linux Utilities: Commands such as mkdir, rmdir, mv, rm, ls, and cat

- Command-Line Interface (CLI): To simulate real-world system administration tasks
