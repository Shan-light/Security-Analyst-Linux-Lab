# Security-Analyst-Linux-Lab
Practice managing files and directories in Linux using Bash commands.

## Objectives
This project demonstrates how to manage files and directories in Linux using basic Bash commands. The tasks simulate a real-world scenario for a security analyst who needs to organize directories and maintain proper documentation.

## Skills Learned
- Navigating the Linux file system using Bash
  
- Creating and removing directories with mkdir and rmdir
  
- Moving, renaming, and deleting files with mv and rm
  
- Editing text files with the nano editor
  
- Verifying directory structures and file contents with ls and cat
  
- Applying file management practices used by system administrators and security analysts
  
- Documenting tasks and changes in a structured way

## Tools Used
- Linux (Bash Shell): For executing file and directory management commands

- Nano Text Editor: For creating and editing text files in the command line

- Core Linux Utilities: Commands such as mkdir, rmdir, mv, rm, ls, and cat
